# set and dictionary are hashing based ds
# on list and tuple, finding an element takes n tries, while comparing each element in lust/tuple with the one to be found
# we can quickly retrive information using hashing
# Hashing means converting huge data in to simple integers/slots that will keep those values and when we need to find a value in that ds, we can hash the value again and find its particular slot is empty or not
