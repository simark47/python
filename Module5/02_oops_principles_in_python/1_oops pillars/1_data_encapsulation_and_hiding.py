# like we made a circle class all wrapped up all the related data and methods in to circle class all together
# this is called data encapsulation. classes and objects support encapsulation

#  when we imported and use class circle's methods like area, point on circle and circumference, we do not know the internal working of it, but still use it. This is called abstraction. certain internal working can be kept hidden

# Data hiding: We should hide certain data and only be allowed to change via some functions
# after constructing a circle, you can access and change its radius like circle.radius by default
